# LearningMyCity

Mobile phones, and especially Smartphones, have become increasingly common in recent years and as a result, pervasive games have become more interesting from both an academic and a commercial point of view. Another area of interest is mobile assisted learning, which offers a more modern approach on education compared to the traditional learning model. In this thesis, we aim to discover whether or not pervasive gaming can assist in learning.

This is done by creating an application on the Android mobile phone operating system called “Learning my City”, and using the experiences drawn from it to examine the contribution of usage of pervasive games in a lifelong learning context. In this context, it is interesting to explore the design process of this particular activity, the rules of the game and the development that involves not only the corresponding technology, but also the involvement of related historical information. 

LearningMyCity is an adventure game that challenges you to explore your city through natural wandering, searching and solving puzzles that point to a historical retrospection. Find all historical historical monuments, answer different types of questions and drive yourself or your team to the top of the scoreboard!
